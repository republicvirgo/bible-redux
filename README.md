Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sonnylazuardi/redux-bible.git
$ cd redux-bible
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

Usage
-----

* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.
* Deploying to an environment? `npm run deploy` can help with that.

Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

* `npm start` - Spins up express server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).
* `npm run dev:nw` - Same as `npm start`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.
* `npm run dev:no-debug` - Same as `npm start` but disables redux devtools.
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.
* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.
* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
* `npm run lint`- Lint all `.js` files.
* `npm run lint:fix` - Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).

```

Testing
-------

To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them.

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/_base.js`.
